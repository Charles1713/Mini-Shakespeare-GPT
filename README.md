# Mini-Shakespeare-GPT
This project creates a machine learning model that takes in arbitrary text data and outputs data in that style.
This project was created from scratch following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY which is based off of Attention is all you Need. This project differs by using gradient clipping, different hyperparameters and adds temperature.
